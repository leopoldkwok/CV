| An internet-of-things printer, powered by Spark Core. Reads RFID tags and prints out a chit based on your preferences. Final group project at Makers Academy. | Shameless Instagram clone, written in Rails during week 8/9 at Makers Academy. Uses Bootstrap for styling and accepts payments using Stripe. | TNT's web tracker is awful. I wanted to make a better one using Sinatra and Mechanize (a web-scraping gem), and host it using Dokku. Side project while at Makers Academy. |
